3. SYSTEM FLOW (DETAILED)
1. Event Preparation
Admin → Creates event → Sets requirements → Uploads participant list → Generates event QR code.
2. Registration / Login
Participant logs in → Views list of events → Selects event.
3. Attendance Flow
Participant → Scans event QR code → Backend logs attendance → Admin sees real-time updates.
4. Evaluation Flow
Evaluation becomes accessible ONLY after:
Attendance is valid


Session requirements are met


Participant → Submits evaluation → Data stored → Admin receives analytics.
5. Verification Engine
System checks:
Attendance completed?


Evaluation finished?


Quiz passed (if required)?


If YES to all → eligible for certificate.
6. Certificate
Backend generates PDF


Email sent automatically


Participant downloads from portal


Admin can resend or override


7. Archiving & Reports
